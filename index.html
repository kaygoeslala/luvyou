Feliz dia de san valen- OH WAIT! You dont know spanish.. My bad! ––Happy Valentines baby!!!! I wish you were here right now, it kinda sucks that you arent and the fact you’re my first Valentine too but I’ll still enjoy what the day will give us
<br><br>
Before you, i was in a really bad mental state and I genuinely believe that god saw me struggling and going thru the worst days of my life, so he gave me you. He gave me the kindest, sweetest, understanding, loving man ever. He knew that all i needed was a man like you. You were there everytime i needed someone and i truly am blessed to have you. Thats how i know that god is real. You dont know how much care and love i have for you and i hope that it shows.  I honestly dont even know how i’d survive without you (corny).  I want to grow old with you. getting groceries together, fridge magnets, a cozy home, maybe even go to a country we both want to go. generally just be with you. I hope you know the things id do for you no matter what extent.
<br><br>
 Genuinely,  you have been a blessing to me. You deserve credit for helping me improve as a person and helped me over come some stuff that was due to be overlooked.  Even though were oceans away, you still never fail to make me smile and brighten my days. I am forever in debt to you. You just being there and staying alive is all i ever need, i dont need anything else just you.  I love that we just kinda laugh at everything n our lil inside jokes, I love how you percieve things and how insightful you are, I love how you never try to lie or anything when we have “arguments”. 
<br><br>
You know, sometimes I look back to our old conversations and I’d cry because theres times where id be a total b-word and you’re just there not saying a word about it makes me hate myself for saying those things when I shouldve been telling you how much i appreicate you and love you. Though i dont say it as often, I hope you know i DO appreciate every single little thing you do and every thing you sacrifice to talk to me. I loved it when you still came over despite you being busy with moving, really showed me that you’re willing to see me no matter the situation and i’d do the same too. 
<br><br>
I love you now as I write this, and I love you now as you read this ♡
